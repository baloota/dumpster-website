<p>Need to transfer your existing contacts from your iPhone to new Android device? Don&#8217;t worry, transferring that information is not as complicated as you might think. </p>



<p>Here are a few ways you can start the process of moving all of your old information to your new Android device. </p>



<h3>1. Transfer from iPhone to Android with Google&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If your Android device is already set up with a Google account, you can sync the information and contact data on your iPhone phone. If you don’t have an account, you can set one up for free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next step is to open up your settings and tap into “Mail, Contacts, Calendars.”&nbsp; This is where you’ll enter in your Google account. Press the “Add Account” button, select the Gmail option, and enter in your login information.</p>



<p>Your iPhone will then ask which parts of your Google account you’d like to sync. Make sure the Contacts option is selected; then your iPhone and Android devices will start syncing contacts with one another. This is the part where you’ll need to be patient. If you have a lot of contacts, it could take awhile. Just make sure to keep an internet connection active while your contacts are syncing.</p>



<p>It should be noted that your iPhone won’t tell you when your contacts are done syncing. To check on their progress, navigate to the <a href="https://contacts.google.com/u/0/preview/all">Google Contacts</a> website from your desktop, sign in with your Google account, and check up on the list of contacts from there.</p>



<p>Once your contacts are done syncing, log in to your Android device with your Google account information, and you should be all set!</p>



<h3>2. Transfer from iCloud</h3>



<p>If iCloud is already up and running on your iPhone, then this is by far the easiest way to start the process of transferring contacts from one device to the other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turn on your iPhone, tap into your Settings, tap “Mail, Contacts, Calendars”, then choose “Accounts.” You’ll want to open iCloud and then tap on the switch for “Contacts”. The iPhone should immediately ask you for permission to “Merge” your stored contacts.</p>



<p>After the transfer is complete, you’ll want to log into the iCloud website and then tap or click on “Contacts.” Select the settings button, then press “Select All.” Once it’s selected, click the wheel once again and choose “Export vCard”.</p>



<p>Then you’ll want to open <a href="https://gmail.com/">G</a><a href="http://www.gmail.com/">mail</a> in a seperate tab or window, click on the “Mail” button, then select “Contacts”. Click the “More” tab, select “Import”, select “Choose File”, then select your saved vCard file. After all of the contact information is finished importing, you should see a prompt that shows you the number of contacts that are now on Gmail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. Transfer with Email or text</h3>



<p>This method is more time consuming, but if you have no other option, it could be the way to go! Especially if you only have a handful of contacts that you need to transfer from iPhone to your Android.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply open your contacts and tap on the contact of your choosing. Then scroll down to transfer that contact information, either via email or text. Of course, you wouldn’t want to do this if you need hundreds of contacts transferred, but if you only need a handful of important phone numbers, names, and email addresses sent to your other phone, then it might be worth the hassle.</p>



<h3>Don&#8217;t Lose Your Phone Contacts or Photos!</h3>
