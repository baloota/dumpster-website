										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Google Play is the biggest app store in the world. With billions of Android users found in almost 200 global territories, a listing in the Google Play store is a must. However, with so much competition, it can be tough to get noticed. To stand out from the crowd, do what you can to become a featured app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is a featured app on Google Play?</strong></h2>



<p>The Google Play store has&nbsp;<a href="https://buildfire.com/app-statistics/">2.8 million apps</a>&nbsp;for Android users to choose from.&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">Dumpster</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector&amp;hl=en">Cover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.xcleaner&amp;hl=en">X Cleaner</a>&nbsp;are among these.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such choice is excellent for consumers, but you may understandably be intimidated by this level of competition. If you have&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/developing-an-android-app/">developed an Android app</a>, how can you hope to get noticed among such a crowd?</p>



<p>One way to attract an audience is to become a featured app on the Google Play store. The Big G shine a spotlight on featured apps in four separate lists.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Featured Apps</strong>&nbsp;– the gold standard – an app that the Google Play team consider to be an outstanding addition to the platform and will be&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/10-most-useful-android-apps-in-everyday-life/">helpful for everyday users</a></li><li><strong>Staff Picks</strong>&nbsp;– the Google Play team will each have their preferences for apps. If a staff member takes a shine to your app, it may appear on this list</li><li><strong>Editor&#8217;s Choice –</strong>&nbsp;we&#8217;ll be honest, this list is a tough nut to crack. The Android apps of all time make up this list, so you&#8217;ll be competing with the likes of Netflix, Instagram, and Google Maps</li><li><strong>Top Developers –</strong>&nbsp;create enough apps that see traction on the Google Play store, and you may be considered a leading developer</li></ul>



<h2><strong>What are the advantages of being a featured app on Google Play?</strong></h2>



<p>In many respects, searching in the Google Play Store is similar to using the search engine. You&#8217;ll think of something you need, enter some keywords, and wait for the results to fill your screen.</p>



<p>Now, with almost 3 millions apps, you may not be at the top of the list. Again, like the search engine, apps are ranked according to a wide range of complex and secretive algorithms.</p>



<p>Be honest with yourself – how often do you scroll past the first page of a Google search? In fact, how often do you look past the first five or six matches before you find what you need? Such competition is why websites do what they can to feature at the top of the first page. The same applies to the app store.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a featured app, you&#8217;ll be much more visible to users. Such visibility will attract more downloads and reviews, which will improve your organic ranking and see you make the charts of your app niche.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, you&#8217;ll start to see the positive impact this can have on your bottom line.</p>



<h2><strong>Examples of featured apps on Google Play</strong></h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re wondering what makes the cut as a featured app on Google Play, here are three examples at the time of writing.</p>



<h3><strong>Candy Crush Saga</strong></h3>



<p>It&#8217;s hardly a secret that mobile games are a big business –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/01/07/uk-mobile-gaming-market-grows-50-during-pandemic">and it&#8217;s only getting bigger</a>. Creating a game that people want to play and uploading it to the Google Play store can be a huge money-spinner. Your advertising revenue could go through the roof, while there will also be the opportunity for in-game purchases and merchandising.</p>



<p>Best of all, as proved by Candy Crush – arguably the most prominent gaming behemoth of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century – you don&#8217;t need to create anything complex packed with 3D graphics and Hollywood-worthy production values. Candy Crush has dominated the market thanks to simple, addictive gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Depop</strong></h3>



<p>Depop is a used clothing app currently featured on the Google Play store. We chose to showcase this app as it&#8217;s an excellent example of an ecommerce app that is gaining traction, despite lacking brand recognition or a marketing budget to compare with high street giants.</p>



<p>Another thing that is interesting about Depop is that it is clearly not flawless. Check the reviews of the app – you&#8217;ll see several users raising concerns about performance. The manufacturers are taking the time to address and resolve these problems, though. Google love that level of interaction and dedication to customer care.</p>



<h3><strong>Driving Theory Test 4-in-1 Kit</strong></h3>



<p>You do not need to offer an app for free to be featured on the Play Store. Something for nothing will always be appealing, but people are happy to pay for a helpful app. Take this guide to passing the driving theory test, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may retail at £4.99, but it could change a user&#8217;s life. Google Play knows this, and so do customers. Just be careful. If you&nbsp;<em>are&nbsp;</em>going to charge for an app, you&#8217;ll need to be particularly vigilant about maintaining it.</p>



<h2><strong>How to become a featured app on Google Play</strong></h2>



<p>The first tip should be obvious, but it bears confirming anyway – your app needs to perform flawlessly. Google is a business that banks on a reputation for reliability.&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals">Check your app&#8217;s vitals</a>, ensuring that it does not lag, crash, or provide users with any other kind of issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A high-performing app will attract positive reviews, which is another crucial influence on the Play Store&#8217;s featured apps. You&#8217;ll likely need a high rating to rank as a featured app. Why would Google push an app deemed average when there will no doubt be an alternative that has been dubbed superior?</p>



<p>You may not attract five-star reviews when you first launch. Pay attention to any feedback, responding in public and ironing out any kinks in performance. Responding to reviews shows a willingness to improve and theoretically improves your overall ranking.</p>



<p>A score will also, in theory, attract more downloads of your app. Become a featured app is something of a chick-and-egg scenario. Getting featured ensures more downloads &#8211; but you&#8217;ll also need a whole lot of downloads to be featured. Raise awareness of your app however you can.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.creative.onl/app-store-optimisation/">App store optimisation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2015/11/07/65-simple-ways-to-promote-your-mobile-app/">paid advertising campaigns</a>&nbsp;are advisable.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Getting your app featured will make a significant difference to your performance in the Google Play store. If you want to do your part to help&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">Dumpster</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector&amp;hl=en">Cover</a>&nbsp;get featured, please download our apps now. In the meantime, continue working on perfecting your app. You&#8217;ll be glad that you did.</p>

<p>Lost your AirPods? If you’re an Android user, unfortunately, you can’t just turn on “Find my AirPods” to locate your missing pair. However, there is one extremely fast &amp; easy way to track them down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll share a top secret efficiency hack for all Android users that own AirPods. Keep reading to find out one of our favorite utility Android apps! </p>



<h3>Can You Use AirPods on Android?</h3>



<p>Due to contrary belief, yes, you can use AirPods on almost any Android phone or tablet. Although AirPods were designed with Apple products in mind, as long as bluetooth is enabled, AirPods will be able to connect to almost any device, regardless of operating system.</p>



<p>AirPods don&#8217;t have a lot of their functionality on Android, such as: Siri, customized double tap, single AirPod listening, and so on, but you are still able to listen to audio. </p>



<h3>How to Find Your Airpods</h3>



<p>The fastest way to find your AirPods if you’re an Android device user, is to download an app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hf.findlostdevice&amp;hl=en_US">Wunderfind</a>: Find lost device &#8211; headphones. It&#8217;s an app that does exactly what it says it does! It can find your lost headphones, including AirPods, almost instantaneously. </p>



<p>Once it’s installed, all you need to do is select the device you need to find, in this case AirPods, then walk around so the app can detect how close you are to them. Wunderfind’s Device Radar and Distance Score is what makes it great to use for practically any device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s Device Radar is a unique functionality that shows you all of the Android or iOS devices around you within a certain distance. And it’s Distance Score shows you how close you are to the device of your choosing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We highly recommend using Wunderfind because it’s not just for finding lost AirPods. The app is compatible with the following devices &amp; technologies:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>AirPods</li><li>Apple Pencil</li><li>&nbsp;iPhone</li><li>iPad</li><li>Apple Watch</li><li>Portable Speakers</li><li>Fitbit Trackers</li><li>And more</li></ul>



<p>Wunderfind is truly one of the most life-saving Android apps to have installed on your device, especially if you listen to music, <a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/how-do-i-undelete-a-podcast-recording/">podcasts</a>, recordings, etc. on a daily basis. </p>



<h3>Do You Accidentally Lose Photos or Videos Frequently?</h3>



<p>If you’re a clumsy or accident-prone person, in general, we’d also recommend you use Dumpster. Dumpster is a backup app that over 40 Million people have used to restore accidentally deleted photos, videos, files, documents, and more!&nbsp;</p>



<h3>No One Ever Regretted Trying Dumpster for Free</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en_US"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Get-it-on-Google-Play.png" alt="" class="wp-image-572" width="323" height="125" srcset="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Get-it-on-Google-Play.png 646w, https://dumpsterapp.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Get-it-on-Google-Play-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></a></figure></div>

<h2>Keep Track of Payments with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waveapps.sales&amp;hl=en_US">Wave</a></h2>



<p>The hardest thing about being an independent photographer or freelancer isn’t the work itself ー it’s managing your finances!</p>



<p>If you need to keep better tabs on who owes you what, or need help organizing payments &amp; invoices in a central place, Wave is exactly the app you need. It’s great to have for managing clients as well as keeping track of all of your records for tax season.</p>



<h2>Check <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sp0n.citizen&amp;hl=en_US">Citizen</a> Before Confirming Shoot Locations</h2>



<p>Citizen is an app that notifies you of real-time safety alerts and live video of incidents happening around you. Citizen notifications have urged people to evacuate burning buildings, deterred school buses from nearby terrorist attacks and have even led to a rescue of a 1-year-old from a stolen car.</p>



<p>Before you and your client visit your shoot location, it’s in your best interest to ensure the location is safe. You’re better off safe than sorry, especially if you’re located in a metro area.</p>

<p>Malicious smartphone hacking is becoming more and more prevalent. There was a 54% increase in breaches in 2019 compared to 2018, and 2020 will see an even more <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/smartphones-face-high-hacking-risk-in-2020-report/articleshow/73056426.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drastic rise in mobile-focused hacking.</a></p>



<p>It’s a terrifying phenomenon, however, there are many easy steps you can take to prevent someone from hacking into your Android phone.</p>



<h2 id="h.ruo06alv3yyk">1. Update your phone with every new release</h2>



<p>Keeping your phone updated with every new Android version release, will ensure your device is up to date with the latest important security &amp; privacy enhancements.</p>



<p>Google almost always includes significant improvements that aren’t necessarily noticeable to the naked eye. This is an easy way to receive the latest security measures and even other general Android improvement updates.</p>



<p>If you don’t know how to update, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl%3Den&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587573919968000">view instructions on Google’s Help Center.&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2 id="h.ruo06alv3yyk-1">2. Facial recognition &amp; long passwords</h2>



<p>The more security measures are in place to get into your phone the better! That said, adding facial recognition, if you can, is always better than not having it.&nbsp;The odds of a criminal being able to unlock it by using their face is close to zero thanks to innovative biometric technologies.</p>



<p>It’s also important to use longer passwords &#8211; not just a 4-digit numeric one. Adding a mix of alphabetic &amp; numeric values, caps, and special characters to your password makes it incredibly difficult for hackers to guess.</p>



<h2 id="h.ruo06alv3yyk-2">3. Try not to use public Wifi</h2>



<p>Free wifi at a public park, cafe, or library is great, but using it also comes with risk! Joining a public Wifi network means that there is&nbsp;no screening or sign up method to use the internet, which means anyone, including a potential hacker, could use it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using data in public places, instead of relying on an unsecured, public network, is highly recommended.</p>



<h2 id="h.9gqd7mp4sg5j">4. Lock Important Apps</h2>



<p>Finance, email, and messaging apps should individually be locked if you’re storing extremely important information on them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h.ruo06alv3yyk-3">5. Don’t download shady apps&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If your gut says an app is sketchy, don’t download it. There are many apps that are developed for the sole purpose of scamming money from you, or stealing your personal information. In fact, 10,000 rogue apps are <a href="https://www.appknox.com/blog/mobile-app-hacking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responsible for 28% of all attacks</a>. </p>



<p>A tip is to recognize &amp; stay away from <a href="https://darkpatterns.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dark patterns</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h.ruo06alv3yyk-4">6. Clean your phone&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you don’t clean your phone on a regular basis, clutter, junk files, and unnecessary information piles up along with the possibility of phishy materials. Cleaning it will improve your Android phone’s performance, efficiency, &amp; speed and will make room in your phone to update to the latest Android version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.baloota.xcleaner&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587573919972000">X-Cleaner</a>, a free Android app that automatically cleans your phone and creates storage in the process.</p>



<h2 id="h.ruo06alv3yyk-5">7. Use two-factor authentication</h2>



<p>Two-factor authentication simply means a method that requires two ways of validating your identity. The way it works is simple. Upon entering your password the second method of verifying will typically arrive by text message.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What makes it so secure is that a two-factor authentication code can only be used only one time. Every time you log in, you&#8217;ll need to use a new code.</p>
