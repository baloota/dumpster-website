<p>Deep Scan Recovery utilizes cutting-edge technology to scan your entire device for lost images, videos and audio files. It&#8217;s able to that by analyzing the following locations on the device:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hidden Folders</strong><br>A hidden file is any file with the hidden attribute turned on. Just as you&#8217;d expect, a file or folder with this attribute toggled on is invisible while browsing through folders — you can&#8217;t see any of them without explicitly allowing all of them to be seen. They are not a security mechanism because access is not restricted &#8211; usually the intent is simply to not &#8220;clutter&#8221; the display of the contents of a directory listing with files the user did not directly create. (source: <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hidden-file-2625898">Lifewire</a>)</li><li><strong>Cache Folders</strong><br>As you use applications, they start storing files to reference later. These files are stored in an app &#8220;cache.&#8221; For instance: When you&#8217;re using a web browser, it&#8217;ll save images you&#8217;ve seen so that they don&#8217;t have to be downloaded every single time the app needs them. This cache saves you time and data (source: <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-and-when-clear-app-cache-or-data-android">Android Police</a>)</li></ul>



<p>Deep Scan Recovery analyzes the files contents and checks for lost images, videos or audio files.</p>
