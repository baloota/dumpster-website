<p>Dumpster is an Android app that functions as a photo, video, audio, document, and uninstalled app recovery tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if you accidentally deleted a photo before installing Dumpster, simply download the app and instantly restore that file with Deep Scan Recovery. Once Dumpster is installed, you’ll have that ability to restore files that were deleted off of your device with our Recycle Bin ー no internet access or significant battery life required.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/13wiHkQecHq1j6rW6cgWasKNmG1Bkyjfo2qxuoQx6IzY0M-pIOT3wbyUH6apdwpsamrX0xNLjyGuqg55PXP9HYKxqA_w-wsyI3DrNgbxLpJAk0aSKUcU2HC_A4ClBh69tKknX7o" alt=""/></figure>



<p>With the Recycle Bin, you’ll have the ability to use Dumpster as a backup. Meaning, Dumpster will automatically store all deleted documents, apps and media files so that you can immediately restore them if you accidentally delete a file again in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Premium users have access to Dumpster’s Cloud Storage, which instantly frees up device storage.&nbsp;</p>
