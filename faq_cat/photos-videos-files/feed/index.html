<p>To delete a file, simply tap the file, and press delete.</p>



<p>Files that are stored in Dumpster will remain there for as long as you have the app installed. If you’d like, you can also change your device settings to auto-clean after a predesignated amount of time.</p>



<p>To do so, tap on the button located in the upper corner of the app’s homepage. Select Auto Clean.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="447" height="1024" src="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Auto-Clean-1-447x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-443" srcset="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Auto-Clean-1-447x1024.png 447w, https://dumpsterapp.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Auto-Clean-1-131x300.png 131w, https://dumpsterapp.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Auto-Clean-1-768x1760.png 768w, https://dumpsterapp.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Auto-Clean-1-670x1536.png 670w, https://dumpsterapp.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Auto-Clean-1.png 804w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" /></figure></div>



<p>Choose how long you would like Dumpster to save your deleted files for, before permanently deleting them from your device:</p>



<ul><li>1 week</li><li>1 month</li><li>3 months</li></ul>
