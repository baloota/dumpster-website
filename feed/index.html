										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amateur photography has never been more popular. The rise of social media, especially Instagram, ensures that it&#8217;s never been easier to visually document our lives for friends, family, and followers. Back in the 1990s, we had to take a polaroid of our dinner like savages.</p>



<p>Naturally, the smartphone has also created a new generation of shutterbugs. You&#8217;ll no longer need to cart around a clunky camera to capture a memory. You can do so while sending a tweet and checking the weather forecast. If you&#8217;re a keen photographer and are considering a new phone, the difference in performance between iPhones and Android devices may swing your decision.</p>



<p>Here at Baloota, we&#8217;re Android all the way. We create apps for Android devices, including&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">Dumpster</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector&amp;hl=en">Cover</a>. The latter is essential for anybody that wants to protect their privacy after taking snapshots. Let&#8217;s review the difference between iOS and Android regarding taking – and editing or storing – pictures.</p>



<h2><strong>Should mobile photographers use Android or iOS?</strong></h2>



<p>Both types of phone are fine for photography. As is often the case in the Android vs iOS debate, it comes down to brand loyalty and personal preference. There are a few specs to discuss, though.</p>



<p>iPhones are pretty uniform in terms of hardware. Early iPhones faced criticism for boasting low-tech cameras, but these days are long gone. The latest model, for example, offers 12 megapixels. 4K video is available, and super high-res still images can be captured – though this will obviously take up plenty of memory space!</p>



<p>Android cameras are a moving feast. Android appliances are available at multiple price points, so they can vary in quality. A cheap Android phone camera may cap its specs at 5 megapixels. If you&#8217;re prepared to splash out on the latest and greatest Samsung Galaxy handset, however, you&#8217;ll have a camera every bit the equal of an iPhone.</p>



<h2><strong>Android apps for photographers</strong></h2>



<p>The fact that Android is a multi-developer platform comes with an advantage over Apple. Some Android phones will offer camera settings not found on an Apple appliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, the relaxed approach that Android takes to third-party apps means that you&#8217;ll have more options when it comes to editing your snaps. There is an abundance of apps that any Android photographer should investigate.</p>



<p>Photography apps are all over the Google Play store, as well as any third-party app stores. You can download a free version of the software in most cases, upgrading to a paid pro account if you consider it necessary.</p>



<p>Just be aware, Apple is fussy for a reason. Most apps in the iOS store are flawless as they go through lengthy, intense quality control testing. The Google Play store is a little more&nbsp;<em>laissez-faire</em>&nbsp;when it comes to bugs and performance issues. Upgrades are also less frequent. It may take a little trial and error to find apps that fit for purpose to meet your needs.</p>



<p>Two apps that will never give you grief are&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector&amp;hl=en">Cover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">Dumpster</a>. Cover is a photo vault that keeps your images secure, ensuring that you need not worry about prying eyes or accidental deletion. If the worst does happen, though, Dumpster can retrieve any deleted image – even those removed before you installed the app.</p>



<h2><strong>Editing photos on an Android appliance&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>As discussed, you&#8217;ll never struggle to find apps for editing photos on an Android handset.&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/best-photo-editing-apps-for-android-photographers/">Anything in this guide will meet your needs</a>, and there are plenty of others to try. Seek out any featured apps in the Google Play store that relate to photography. These will meet with Google&#8217;s seal of approval.</p>



<p>Android devices will also allow users to edit their snaps within Google Photos. These options will be a little more limited. You will be able to crop your images, though. You can also adjust shadows, blur, brightness, and saturation, and even add text or a filter.</p>



<p>Google Photos is largely comparable to Apple Photos. If you&#8217;re comfortable with either of these programs, you won&#8217;t have any issues. Managing, editing, and maintaining your memories will be simple. Look into a specialist app for any advanced needs. Only so much can be achieved without additional support, regardless of your hardware.</p>



<h2><strong>Storing photos on an Android appliance</strong></h2>



<p>Photos are precious and need to be treated as such. In times before smartphones, people stored hard copies of photographs in physical albums. These, in turn, were typically located in a safe place within the home, ensuring they would not be lost. You should take the same care with your digital snaps.</p>



<p>Installing a photo vault is arguably the easiest way to achieve this. By adding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/">Cover</a>&nbsp;to your phone, you&#8217;ll never need to worry about somebody accessing and deleting your images without your consent. It&#8217;s also advisable to&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/6-best-ways-to-backup-photos-in-2021/">store your photos on a cloud drive as a backup measure</a>. Why not give&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/faq/how-does-cloud-storage-work/">Dumpster Cloud</a>&nbsp;a try? It&#8217;s the ultimate way to save handset space, while also enjoying all the benefits of Dumpster.</p>



<h2><strong>Recovering lost photos on an Android appliance</strong></h2>



<p>If you decide not to protect your photos in a vault, you&#8217;ll always be at risk of losing them. Somebody can delete files on a smartphone by accident or design. Ask yourself if any of the following situations could befall you.</p>



<ul><li>You lend your phone to somebody, such as your children, and they accidentally delete images</li><li>Your handset encounters a significant operating issue, and you need to restore factory settings, deleting your image library</li><li>You are idly flicking through photos and delete the wrong snapshot</li><li>The photo library app that you use corrupts, making your photos unviewable</li><li>You install an automatic cleaning app to make space on your phone, and it removes large, memory-draining snaps</li></ul>



<p>There are many ways to&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/5-ways-to-recover-deleted-photos-on-your-android-device/">retrieve lost photos on an Android device</a>. The easiest and more reliable solution, however, is to&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">install Dumpster on your handset</a>. Dumpster does not take up any additional memory on your handset. More importantly, it retrieves images that would otherwise be lost permanently through&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/faq/how-does-deep-scan-recovery-work/">deep scan recovery technology</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re an Android user and a keen photographer, stop shilly-shallying. Download&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector&amp;hl=en">Cover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">Dumpster</a>&nbsp;right now. We assure you, these apps will help you up your photo game. They also offer a measure of protection that you will not find in other apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Google Play is the biggest app store in the world. With billions of Android users found in almost 200 global territories, a listing in the Google Play store is a must. However, with so much competition, it can be tough to get noticed. To stand out from the crowd, do what you can to become a featured app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is a featured app on Google Play?</strong></h2>



<p>The Google Play store has&nbsp;<a href="https://buildfire.com/app-statistics/">2.8 million apps</a>&nbsp;for Android users to choose from.&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">Dumpster</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector&amp;hl=en">Cover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.xcleaner&amp;hl=en">X Cleaner</a>&nbsp;are among these.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such choice is excellent for consumers, but you may understandably be intimidated by this level of competition. If you have&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/developing-an-android-app/">developed an Android app</a>, how can you hope to get noticed among such a crowd?</p>



<p>One way to attract an audience is to become a featured app on the Google Play store. The Big G shine a spotlight on featured apps in four separate lists.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Featured Apps</strong>&nbsp;– the gold standard – an app that the Google Play team consider to be an outstanding addition to the platform and will be&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/10-most-useful-android-apps-in-everyday-life/">helpful for everyday users</a></li><li><strong>Staff Picks</strong>&nbsp;– the Google Play team will each have their preferences for apps. If a staff member takes a shine to your app, it may appear on this list</li><li><strong>Editor&#8217;s Choice –</strong>&nbsp;we&#8217;ll be honest, this list is a tough nut to crack. The Android apps of all time make up this list, so you&#8217;ll be competing with the likes of Netflix, Instagram, and Google Maps</li><li><strong>Top Developers –</strong>&nbsp;create enough apps that see traction on the Google Play store, and you may be considered a leading developer</li></ul>



<h2><strong>What are the advantages of being a featured app on Google Play?</strong></h2>



<p>In many respects, searching in the Google Play Store is similar to using the search engine. You&#8217;ll think of something you need, enter some keywords, and wait for the results to fill your screen.</p>



<p>Now, with almost 3 millions apps, you may not be at the top of the list. Again, like the search engine, apps are ranked according to a wide range of complex and secretive algorithms.</p>



<p>Be honest with yourself – how often do you scroll past the first page of a Google search? In fact, how often do you look past the first five or six matches before you find what you need? Such competition is why websites do what they can to feature at the top of the first page. The same applies to the app store.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a featured app, you&#8217;ll be much more visible to users. Such visibility will attract more downloads and reviews, which will improve your organic ranking and see you make the charts of your app niche.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, you&#8217;ll start to see the positive impact this can have on your bottom line.</p>



<h2><strong>Examples of featured apps on Google Play</strong></h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re wondering what makes the cut as a featured app on Google Play, here are three examples at the time of writing.</p>



<h3><strong>Candy Crush Saga</strong></h3>



<p>It&#8217;s hardly a secret that mobile games are a big business –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/01/07/uk-mobile-gaming-market-grows-50-during-pandemic">and it&#8217;s only getting bigger</a>. Creating a game that people want to play and uploading it to the Google Play store can be a huge money-spinner. Your advertising revenue could go through the roof, while there will also be the opportunity for in-game purchases and merchandising.</p>



<p>Best of all, as proved by Candy Crush – arguably the most prominent gaming behemoth of the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century – you don&#8217;t need to create anything complex packed with 3D graphics and Hollywood-worthy production values. Candy Crush has dominated the market thanks to simple, addictive gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Depop</strong></h3>



<p>Depop is a used clothing app currently featured on the Google Play store. We chose to showcase this app as it&#8217;s an excellent example of an ecommerce app that is gaining traction, despite lacking brand recognition or a marketing budget to compare with high street giants.</p>



<p>Another thing that is interesting about Depop is that it is clearly not flawless. Check the reviews of the app – you&#8217;ll see several users raising concerns about performance. The manufacturers are taking the time to address and resolve these problems, though. Google love that level of interaction and dedication to customer care.</p>



<h3><strong>Driving Theory Test 4-in-1 Kit</strong></h3>



<p>You do not need to offer an app for free to be featured on the Play Store. Something for nothing will always be appealing, but people are happy to pay for a helpful app. Take this guide to passing the driving theory test, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may retail at £4.99, but it could change a user&#8217;s life. Google Play knows this, and so do customers. Just be careful. If you&nbsp;<em>are&nbsp;</em>going to charge for an app, you&#8217;ll need to be particularly vigilant about maintaining it.</p>



<h2><strong>How to become a featured app on Google Play</strong></h2>



<p>The first tip should be obvious, but it bears confirming anyway – your app needs to perform flawlessly. Google is a business that banks on a reputation for reliability.&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals">Check your app&#8217;s vitals</a>, ensuring that it does not lag, crash, or provide users with any other kind of issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A high-performing app will attract positive reviews, which is another crucial influence on the Play Store&#8217;s featured apps. You&#8217;ll likely need a high rating to rank as a featured app. Why would Google push an app deemed average when there will no doubt be an alternative that has been dubbed superior?</p>



<p>You may not attract five-star reviews when you first launch. Pay attention to any feedback, responding in public and ironing out any kinks in performance. Responding to reviews shows a willingness to improve and theoretically improves your overall ranking.</p>



<p>A score will also, in theory, attract more downloads of your app. Become a featured app is something of a chick-and-egg scenario. Getting featured ensures more downloads &#8211; but you&#8217;ll also need a whole lot of downloads to be featured. Raise awareness of your app however you can.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.creative.onl/app-store-optimisation/">App store optimisation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2015/11/07/65-simple-ways-to-promote-your-mobile-app/">paid advertising campaigns</a>&nbsp;are advisable.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Getting your app featured will make a significant difference to your performance in the Google Play store. If you want to do your part to help&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">Dumpster</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector&amp;hl=en">Cover</a>&nbsp;get featured, please download our apps now. In the meantime, continue working on perfecting your app. You&#8217;ll be glad that you did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Here at Baloota, we love the Android format. That&#8217;s why we chose to make our app empire, which presently comprises&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">Dumpster</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector&amp;hl=en">Cover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.xcleaner&amp;hl=en">X Cleaner</a>, Android-only. Sorry, iOS.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not naïve, though. We appreciate that Android apps can sometimes cause headaches for users. That&#8217;s why we drew up this guide to common pain points with Android apps and how a user can resolve them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Do Android apps often have problems?</h2>



<p>It would be too simplistic to say that Android apps are more problematic than their iOS equivalents. Unfortunately, to an extent, it would also be true.</p>



<p>The reason for this simple. Anybody can upload an app to the Google Play store. The cost to do so is pretty menial, and Google does not have a strict quality control policy. As a result, apps can be rushed and uploaded without testing, despite being riddled with bugs.</p>



<p>Over at iOS, the opposite is true. Apple forces any app developer to sign up for an expensive annual subscription. Weeks of vigorous testing are also undertaken before releasing apps for download. Such restrictions lead to higher performance, but equally, they can frequently crush and stifle creativity.</p>



<h2>What common issues arise in Android apps?</h2>



<p>If you&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/developing-an-android-app/">develop an Android app</a>, you&#8217;ll have a huge potential target audience that may express interest in downloading it. To impress consumers, though, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that your app is flawless.</p>



<p>Never upload an app without putting it through plenty of tests. Releasing an app that is not fit for purpose will just infuriate people, leading to negative reviews and damaging your reputation.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, issues with apps are hardware concerns and have nothing to do with buggy coding. If you are having trouble with your Android apps or customers are complaining that your app is not performing as it should, consider these fixes.</p>



<h3>Refusing to download</h3>



<p>If an app is refusing to download, how much memory you have left on a device. You&#8217;d be amazed at much space MP3s and HD videos can consume. Remember that if somebody sends you a video on WhatsApp, it may automatically save to your camera roll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you can&#8217;t bring yourself to part with photos, videos or music, consider your apps. Take a look at the apps that you have downloaded &#8211; are they all strictly necessary? Once space gets tight, you may need to operate a &#8220;one out, one in&#8221; policy. Consider deleting anything that you have not used in more than a week or two.</p>



<p>If this still does not help, the issue may lie with the Google Play store. To achieve this, clear your cache. Head to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, then&nbsp;<strong>Apps</strong>. Open the Google Play Store app, then tap&nbsp;<strong>Clear Data</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Clear Cache</strong>. You may also want to restart your appliance after this.</p>



<h3>Regular crashing</h3>



<p>Crashing apps may be a problem with the developer. Java can be a harsh mistress, and errors in code can prevent an app from running correctly. Check the reviews in the app store. If everybody is having the same problem, the issue is unlikely at your end.</p>



<p>If the issue is unique to you, check our previous point. You may need to clear the cache of the Google Play store. Consider checking for any updates to the app, too. You may be running an old version that is incompatible with the latest OS.</p>



<p>The opposite could also be true, though. You may have an old handset that cannot cope with the demands of the app. If you cannot install the latest OS, it may be time to upgrade to a new device. The problem will keep arising otherwise.</p>



<h3>Draining phone battery&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Apps that drain battery can be hugely infuriating. There are a handful of ways to get around this.</p>



<ul><li>If possible, use the app on 4G or 5G rather than wi-fi</li><li>Deactivate unnecessary features of the app, such as location tracking</li><li>Close the app down not in use</li><li>Turn your brightness as low as you can without impacting your ability to see the screen</li></ul>



<p>Remember, batteries have a finite shelf life. The more you use high-impact apps, the shorter lifespan a full battery will offer. Prolong your battery as long as you can by following the steps above.</p>



<h3>Slow performance</h3>



<p>The whole point of apps is to enjoy fast, practical convenience. If your apps are running at a snail&#8217;s pace, check what else is active on your phone. Other programs may be slowing down your entire appliance.</p>



<p>Internet pages are the likeliest culprits. Ensure you do not have any websites with video advertisements running in the background. These will place pressure on your appliance and slow everything down. An ad blocker may help with this – though be aware that these are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/a-content-blocker-is-different-to-an-ad-blockers/">not the same as content blockers</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Installation of malware</h3>



<p>One of the biggest concerns with Google Play operating a Wild West-style approach to allowing apps is the risk of malware. If you&#8217;re not careful, you may invite viruses into your smartphone by installing a third-party app.</p>



<p>If you suspect that malware is present on your phone, you&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;take action. Download, install and run an anti-virus program. Anti-virus software will be your first line of defence, but not the last. Your phone may still behave erratically, and you could still be in danger.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that somebody installed malware on your phone with no consequence. Change all your passwords – they have almost certainly been compromised. Install a photo vault like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/">Cover</a>, move all your images, and restore factory settings. It&#8217;s likely that somebody, somewhere, has access to the contents of your phone –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/how-to-safely-hide-your-private-content-a-6-step-process/">including your private data</a>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Android appliances can host a wide array of spectacular apps … but equally, more than their share of duds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do your due diligence before installing an app to your phone or tablet, ensuring that it&#8217;s of sufficient quality. If you&#8217;re creating an app for Android, test, test and test some more before you upload it to the Google Play store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more similar advice, be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en">install Dumpster</a>&nbsp;and check back on our blog regularly. We&#8217;re constantly uploading new hints and tips for Android users to make your life easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Rooting&#8221; an Android device is the act of unlocking the OS of your smartphone or tablet. This practice first gained attention with the earliest generation of iPhones. When performing this process on an iOS appliance, it is known as &#8220;jailbreaking.&#8221;</p>



<h2>What is rooting an Android device?</h2>



<p>The term rooting refers to the fact that you&#8217;ll have root access to your smartphone or tablet. This is the portable equivalent of becoming an admin user of a desktop computer. There is nothing that you cannot change on a rooted device. Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on your perspective.</p>



<p>By default, users cannot tamper with the OS of an Android device. On paper, this means that you will not accidentally delete any critical functions of a phone, rendering it useless.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a more cynical audience may claim that these restrictions prevent Android users from achieving true liberty and keep them under the control of Google.</p>



<h2>Why do people root their Android devices?</h2>



<p>One of the main reasons that people root their Android devices is to enjoy more personalisation. With a rooted appliance, you can change the logo on your screen when you boot up. You can alter the default font, create a unique lock screen … the possibilities are endless. These changes all sound a little superficial – and they are. Minor, aesthetic differences can make a big difference to user experience, though.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most significant advantage of rooting an Android phone is the freedom it provides to tinker with apps, though. Ordinarily, you can only adjust apps according to the settings assigned by manufacturers. A rooted phone offers complete control. If you are a skilled user, you can maximise the performance of your apps &#8211; potentially extending the lifespan of a device.</p>



<p>Rooted appliances can also delete pre-installed apps, often referred to as Bloatware. You know the ones we mean – apps that simply waste space on your phone, but you cannot remove them. Samsung is particularly guilty of this. Android stores these apps in the equivalent of the C drive in a smartphone or tablet – usually off-limits to users. Rooted devices will not endure this restriction.</p>



<h2>Can I install iOS apps on a rooted Android device?</h2>



<p>If your Android appliance is rooted, you can &#8220;sideload&#8221; apps onto your device. Sideloading means installing unofficial apps that you cannot source from the Google Play store. You may want to continue using an old app that is no longer supported or an app that Google refuse to acknowledge.</p>



<p>There is a restriction here, though. Rooting does not allow Android users to install apps from the iOS store.&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/developing-an-android-app/">Android apps are developed</a>&nbsp;using different code from their Apple counterparts. As a result, the two systems remain incompatible. Asking Android to run an iOS-only app, or vice versa, is like trying to converse with a French speaker in Russian.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are ways to use iOS apps on Android using an emulator, but we do not recommend it. Rooting your device is already risky, as we&#8217;ll discuss in a moment. If you start messing with more options, you&#8217;ll leave your appliance at risk. A Google search will reveal how you can achieve this aim, but we will not detail them here as we cannot condone such actions.</p>



<h2>Should I root my Android appliance?</h2>



<p>Rooting an Android device is a matter of personal preference. If you are considering rooting your smartphone or tablet, we recommend asking yourself three questions.</p>



<ul><li>Are you comfortable with the tech implications of being an Android superuser?</li><li>Do you have a good reason to root your device?</li><li>What will you do if something goes awry and you accidentally brick your appliance?</li></ul>



<p>Do not just root your Android device for the heck of it. There are risks involved, so you should only attempt this if you have a compelling reason. The hazards inherent in rooting an Android smartphone or tablet include:</p>



<ul><li>Complete lack of protection for crucial OS functions – if you accidentally delete a fundamental program, there is no turning back</li><li>Rooting Android devices voids any warranty and insurance policies you have on your phone or tablet</li><li>Hackers will find it much easier to install malware on your appliance, placing your security and privacy at risk – a third party will have unrestricted access to every element of your device</li><li>You will not be able to install any standard OS upgrades straight from the source. You&#8217;ll have to find a third-party upgrade, which comes with risk</li><li>Some app developers install security procedures in official apps from the Google Play store that prevents them from being used on rooted devices. Banking apps and entertainment packages like Netflix are the most prominent examples</li></ul>



<p>The most considerable risk will always be the chance of completely trashing your appliance, though. Our advice? Back up everything before you start and only root your phone if you have a Plan B, such as the financial means to buy a replacement if things go wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How to root an Android device&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you have weighed up the pros and cons of rooting a device and have decided to go ahead, you have two main choices.</p>



<ul><li>Install an app to do the rooting for you</li><li>Find a shop or private phone expert that will root the phone</li></ul>



<p>There are risks to both approaches. Apps are typically easy to use, but some are safer and more reliable than others. As Android runs on countless different phones, you&#8217;ll also need to find an app suitable for your manufacturer. Check online forums (Reddit is typically a font of all internet knowledge) to find the best software for a Samsung, LG, Huawei or Lenovo model.</p>



<p>If you take your phone to a shop, they&#8217;ll likely be able to root it in a matter of moments. In theory, this is the safest option. In reality, though, you&#8217;re handing complete control of your phone to a stranger. As we mentioned, rooting means that somebody can install any kind of software, compromising your security. Only approach somebody that you trust implicitly.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There are pros and cons to rooting an Android device. If you are comfortable with making changes to the OS of your appliance, you&#8217;ll certainly enjoy a lot of benefits. Just be aware that it&#8217;s easy to make a real mess when a phone is rooted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only attempt this if you are confident in your tech skills – and can think of a compelling reason why a rooted phone would improve your life. In the meantime,&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/tips/">be sure to bookmark Dumpster for more Android tips</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the age of the smartphone, apps are big business. In the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, over half of all worldwide internet users opt to <a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/mobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics#post-navigation-0">surf the net on a smartphone or tablet rather than a desktop computer</a>. The use of apps over a web browser is a natural evolution of this process.</p>



<p>When developing an Android app, you need to understand that it will be designed exclusively for a smaller screen and can get a user from A to B substantially faster. Apps can also tailor specialist services to portable device users. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/">Cover</a>&nbsp;will work to keep adult content away from a smartphone that may be accessed by unsuspecting eyes, and&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/">Dumpster</a>&nbsp;ensures that precious photographs snapped by mobile photographers are not lost.</p>



<p>The overwhelming volume of apps in circulation –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271644/worldwide-free-and-paid-mobile-app-store-downloads/">almost 220 billion apps were downloaded in 2020 alone</a>&nbsp;– adds credence to this theory. Developing an app is the fastest way to the hearts and minds of consumers, especially using the Android format.</p>



<h2><strong>Why develop an Android app?</strong></h2>



<p>You may have noticed that we have advised on the creation of an Android app, not iOS – or even cross-platform. Naturally, it&#8217;s entirely down to personal preference as to which platform you embrace. There are many reasons to focus your efforts on Android, though. These include:</p>



<ul><li>Some western nations have an even split of Android and iOS enthusiasts. Globally, however, Android drastically outmuscles Apple – a staggering&nbsp;<a href="https://leftronic.com/blog/android-vs-ios-market-share/">87% of the world&#8217;s smartphone and tablet market</a>&nbsp;will use Android by 2022</li><li>Android and iOS use different coding languages – Java for Android, Objective-C or Swift for iOS. Java is widely regarded as the most user-friendly language for coding novices</li><li>It&#8217;s much easier to get an app accepted and uploaded to the Google Play store than the iOS equivalent. Apple has extremely stringent quality control measures that take weeks to pass</li><li>It costs just $25 as a one-off payment to upload unlimited apps to the Google Play store. App developers must sign up for annual membership to the Apple Developer Program for $99 per year to use the iOS store</li></ul>



<p>Again, it&#8217;s a matter of preference for any individual app developer. We stand by our suggestion that developing an Android app is the best way to make a mark on this industry, though.</p>



<h2><strong>What skills are required to develop an Android app?</strong></h2>



<p>Developing an app is not necessarily an undertaking for the faint-hearted – though, as discussed, it&#8217;s a little easier with Android than iOS. If you already have a basic understanding and knowledge of Java, you&#8217;re halfway to having the necessary skills.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/">Online courses to teach you the ropes</a>&nbsp;are available if this is not the case.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll also need a fundamental understanding of user experience (UX). The downside to Android’s popularity is that competition is fierce. You may struggle to gain attention ahead of similar apps. Before you start developing, ensuring that you understand how to ensure that your app is user-friendly and intuitive. Above all, it needs to do exactly what you claim it will!</p>



<p>This also means that you&#8217;ll need some level of business and marketing skill. If your app is going to be successful, it will need to be promoted appropriately. We&#8217;ll discuss this in more detail shortly. Just bear in mind that there is little point in spending your time and effort developing a killer app if nobody knows about it.</p>



<h2><strong>Basic steps to developing an Android app</strong></h2>



<p>If you’re uncomfortable with app development, hire an agency or a freelancer to help. The latter approach will be much cheaper, though it may take longer. If you are ready to tackle the task yourself, the basic steps are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>Come up with a killer idea! A successful app needs to be unique or improve on what is already out there</li><li>Download the tools that you&#8217;ll need from the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a></li><li>Write the code for your app</li><li>Test your app, test it again, and ask friends and family to test it for you. If you upload an Android app that keeps crashing or is riddled with bugs, this will be reflected in your reviews</li><li>Upload your app to the Google Play store and announce its availability to the world</li></ul>



<p>Watch this space for more information. This guide is just for the fundamentals of developing an Android app. In the future, further posts will elaborate on the more advanced actions required.</p>



<h2><strong>Uploading an Android app to the Google Play store</strong></h2>



<p>Once you have signed up for the Google Play store and paid your $25 enrolment fee, you can upload your app. Typically, the app will live and ready for download within 24 hours. Don’t feel obligated to stick with the Google Play store, either.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-app-stores-936652/">Countless third-party app stores support Android</a>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve uploaded the app, you’re not done. You will no doubt be familiar with the concept of SEO. You’ll need to adopt a similar practice here, using what is known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.creative.onl/app-store-optimisation/">app store optimisation</a>. Carefully apply a description and meta tag to your app to aid searches. If you ignore this, your app will slide down the rankings and fail to attract downloads.</p>



<h2><strong>Marketing and promoting an Android app</strong></h2>



<p>Finally, you’ll need to promote your app. In addition to the optimization that we discussed above, attract attention to your app through a range of channels. Ways to do this include:</p>



<ul><li>Advertise your app on your social media accounts, encouraging downloads</li><li>Utilize online SEO tactics to draw in search-based traffic for your app. Blogs, known as content marketing, is a great way to achieve this. After all, you’re aware of&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/">Dumpster</a>&nbsp;as you are reading this article!</li><li>Undertake pay-per-click advertising campaigns on other apps, or through podcasts</li></ul>



<p>Very few apps are overnight money-spinners. You’ll need to be patient and ensure that your audience knows about your app if it is to be successful. If you successfully play the long game, though, you’ll give your app a great chance of finding an audience.</p>



<p>Follow the example of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/">Cover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/">Dumpster</a>&nbsp;by developing an Android app of your very own. Apps are not going anywhere any time soon – so neither is a business that does not embrace this technology. Whether you develop the app yourself or hire an agency is up to you. Just ensure you enter the app market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a world that can often feel overwhelming, it&#8217;s important to have an enjoyable hobby that you find relaxing and grounding. More and more people are turning to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-reasons-photography-great-hobby/">photography as a pastime</a>. One of the most annoying things it not back up photos!</p>



<p>A smartphone or tablet is a great way to embrace this art form, especially as there are&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/best-photo-editing-apps-for-android-photographers/">countless Android apps</a>&nbsp;to help amateur shutterbugs improve their skills and imagery. Naturally, though, smartphone photography can come with a range of challenges. Perhaps the biggest is storage and the fragile nature of keeping images on a phone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy for a photo to be accidentally deleted, making sure you backup photos is essential. You may also want to consider an image vault, like <a href="https://www.coverapp.me/">Cover</a>, for additional protection. First thing&#8217;s first, though. Always be sure to keep your photos backed up on a third-party server. Here are six of the finest on the market today.</p>



<h2><strong>Dumpster</strong></h2>



<p>Look, it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that we consider&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/">Dumpster</a>&nbsp;the finest way to backup photos on a tablet or smartphone, especially when used in conjunction with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/">Cover</a>. There are good reasons for this, though. Dumpster offers the ultimate protection for your images. If you find that you have lost an image,&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/5-ways-to-recover-deleted-photos-on-your-android-device/">Dumpster&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;be able to retrieve it for you</a>.</p>



<p>Even if you&#8217;re careful, there&#8217;s plenty to love about Dumpster as photo backup software. For a start, Dumpster will not take up any space on your appliance. It&#8217;s simple, really – Dumpster needs as much space as your files. If you&#8217;re concerned about your memory allowance, consider using&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.xcleaner&amp;hl=en_US">X Cleaner</a>&nbsp;for the occasional sweep and removal of needless data.</p>



<p>You can also upgrade your account to utilise the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.dumpsterapp.mobi/">Dumpster Web Cloud</a>. This will provide constant access to any photos that have been backed up, wherever you may be. It will also save space on your device. Truly, Dumpster offers the best of all possible worlds when it comes to saving and restoring photos.</p>



<h2><strong>Hard drive</strong></h2>



<p>A computer hard drive is, on paper, a safe way to back up your photos. The average computer, especially a desktop, will have much more storage capacity than a smartphone or tablet. It&#8217;s also easy to transfer files from computers to portable appliances in the modern world.</p>



<p>Just bear in mind that computer hard drives do not last forever. Oftentimes, the motherboard of a computer can give up the ghost with little to no warning. If this happens, everything is lost – including your precious photos. You <em>may</em> be able to get them back if you approach a skilled technician, this is likely to be costly.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re using a hard drive to pack up your photos, consider investing in a USB external hard drive. This is less likely to be rendered redundant than the computer itself. The risk is still there, though. Cloud-based solutions are safer.</p>



<h2><strong>Google Photos</strong></h2>



<p>If you’re an Android user, you’ll almost certainly have access to Google Photos as standard. The Big G offers a generous 15gb of free cloud storage, though this cannot be exclusively used for photos. All other Google apps, including Gmail, make use of this memory allowance.</p>



<p>Google Photos will allow you to backup photos to the cloud, but once they’re gone, they’re gone. It can be problematic to retrieve lost images through Google Photos unless they are still in your recycle bin. </p>



<p><a href="https://safety.google/photos/">Safety protocols on Google Photos are pretty</a>&nbsp;secure, but there is a risk to using such a major cloud network. Google will always attract the attention of malicious hackers, and your photos will be linked to the same password as your email account. Bear this in mind before backing up any images you can consider private.</p>



<h2><strong>iCloud</strong></h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no secret that we&#8217;re Android enthusiasts here at <a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/">Dumpster</a>. We have designed our apps exclusively for use on this platform, after all. That does not mean that we have any issue with Apple though, and iCloud can be a useful storage facility and allow you to backup photos.</p>



<p>iCloud is a universal platform and offers 5gb of storage free. If you want to upgrade, the costs are pretty reasonable. You can enjoy 50gb of storage space for just 99p a month. You&#8217;d need to take a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;of photos to exceed that capacity!</p>



<p>There&#8217;s only one real issue with iCloud. It is, understandably, designed for Apple users. If you are running MacBook but use an Android smartphone or tablet, that&#8217;s not the end of the world. If you do not utilise&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;Apple products, however, you&#8217;ll need to be vigilant about ensuring that your images are backed up regularly.</p>



<h2><strong>Dropbox</strong></h2>



<p>Once upon a time, Dropbox was&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;name in file sharing and cloud storage. Once Google and Apple entered the market, Dropbox lost some of its lustre. It remains a versatile and user-friendly way to back up your files, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The free storage is limited to 2gb, but you can earn an extra 500mb by recommending a friend to install the app. Alternatively, you can pay for a premium subscription and gain more capacity this way.</p>



<p>One of the biggest advantages of Dropbox for photo storage is the disaster recovery features. You can restore an older version of your Dropbox folder, going back as far as 30 days. This will return the contents of your drive to how they looked before the deletion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This both good and bad. Good in that it returns anything you lost, but less than ideal in that you&#8217;ll also need to re-upload anything added after this date.</p>



<h2><strong>Other-Cloud based platforms</strong></h2>



<p>We have touched upon the ‘big three’ of cloud-based storage options above, as well as Dumpster’s offering. These are not your only choices, though. You could consider any of the following:</p>



<ul><li>iDrive</li><li>Microsoft OneDrive</li><li>Flickr</li><li>pCloud</li></ul>



<p>Of course, there&#8217;s always Instagram too. You can always protect your Insta account if you do not want your photos accessible to just anybody.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll still be at the mercy of the whims of Instagram here, though – accounts can be banned or blocked for seemingly innocuous reasons. It also bears remembering that Instagram is owned by Facebook, so you&#8217;ll be exchanging personal data for free photo storage.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>It’s always advisable to back up photos from a smartphone or tablet. One errant thumb swipe, whether from yourself or somebody borrowing your appliance, could banish an image to the ether. Save yourself such heartache by downloading&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/">Cover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/">Dumpster</a>. This will help you sleep easier at night, aware that your photography endeavours are not in vain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Once upon a time, before the smartphone revolution, snapshots were taken on film and handed to a counter in a pharmacy for development. An agonising wait followed. What you received was what you had – no retakes or edits were available. Digital cameras and smartphones have changed this. Anybody can embrace the art of photography in the modern era. What&#8217;s more, external apps ensure that tweaks, filters and adjustments can be made instantly. If you&#8217;re keen to become an Android shutterbug, take a look at these photo editing apps.</p>



<h2><strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong></h2>



<p>Lightroom is an essential download for any serious Android photographer. The basic version is free, with additional features behind paywalls. You can share photos straight from Lightroom to social media feeds. This keeps an all-important Instagram feed active.</p>



<p>The biggest advantage of Lightroom is the breadth of services provided. You can view, edit and arrange your photos within the app. If you snap photos regularly, this saves plenty of time when you need to filter and sort them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lightroom is accessible to amateurs and experienced photographers. You can set the app to automatically edit images or make use of a vast array of manual options. The filters are rich and varied, and if you&#8217;re prepared to pay for the premium upgrade, the sky is the limit as to what you can achieve.</p>



<h2><strong>TouchRetouch</strong></h2>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fake – it&#8217;s been photoshopped&#8221; is the war cry of internet cynics across the world. Many Android photographers smile in the face of such accusations. Photoshop is amazing software, but it&#8217;s complicated to use on a small smartphone screen. TouchRetouch is the next best thing.</p>



<p>This app operates a very simple UX. Just tap the screen to remove objects that you do not want. You can share a striking shot of the sea without the skinny dipper that appeared at the worst possible moment, or remove dust or blurs from an otherwise flawless snap. It&#8217;s also a handy way to extract pesky ex-partners from group shots!</p>



<p>There is a small fee to install TouchRetouch on your smartphone or tablet – £1.99 at the time of writing. We consider this cost worthwhile. It&#8217;s certainly cheaper than any variation of Photoshop.</p>



<h2><strong>Carbon</strong></h2>



<p>Glorious technicolour is great, but there is a lot to be said for black-and-white images. Effective monochrome photography captures a moody and evocative moment in time, stirring a range of emotions.</p>



<p>Most basic camera apps allow you to reduce the colour of an image. Carbon is created by professional photographers, though. This helps a photo achieve astonishing beauty standards. Not every image benefits from black and white, but some – especially headshots and selfies –reach a new level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This app is free to download and offers a range of features. You could add a splash of colour to an image, such as maintaining the hue of the eyes in a monochrome selfie. The usual filters are also available. Carbon is highly recommended for any Android photographer aiming for a varied portfolio.</p>



<h2><strong>VSCO Cam</strong></h2>



<p>Any photographer will be accustomed to Instagram photo editing. There are limits to what can be achieved on that site, though. VSCO can be considered a more advanced version of what the Gram has to offer. As a camera app, VSCO is hugely impressive &#8211; especially as it is free to download.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll have a choice of flashes and can choose from a range of other features, such as shutter speed and colour balancing. If you are in a hurry, just use one of the 10 preset modes. There are a plethora of editing features available on VSCO, so taking the shot is just step one of a far longer journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we love most about VSCO, however, is the community that it attracts. The internet can be a rough place, especially on social media. The users of VSCO are thankfully friendly, so you&#8217;ll never be short of advice or support. If you&#8217;re looking for fellow photographers to discuss the artform with, do not hesitate to install VSCO.</p>



<h2><strong>Pixlr</strong></h2>



<p>We touched upon the complexity of Photoshop editing on a smartphone earlier. There is no denying that Photoshop is a powerful weapon in the arsenal of any photographer, though. That&#8217;s why we also recommend Pixlr. This is one of the very few external apps that allows you to work with a PSD file for editing. From here, the image can be resaved as a JPG.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pixlr is very popular for a range of other reasons, though. It&#8217;s among the most celebrated editing and filtering apps, with a range of preloaded options. You&#8217;ll never struggle to create a unique and original image with this app. It can also be used as a progressive web app, so you can flit between editing on your smartphone and at a desktop computer.</p>



<h2><strong>Superimpose X</strong></h2>



<p>Why settle for one great photo, when you could amalgamate two? That is the service offered by Superimpose X. This is arguably the best app for adding images together. You can use layering or blending to create one image from disparate snapshots. What&#8217;s more, you can remove any unwanted backgrounds to minimise business in the image.</p>



<p>You can save your progress on the app and return to it at any time, so there is no need to rush the perfect image. You can make whatever edits you consider necessary, including the addition of shadow or gradients, and Superimpose X is very simple to use. Whether you&#8217;re experienced in blending photos or trying for the first time, the app will guide you by the hand.</p>



<p>Superimpose X is available in two forms. The standard version comes at a fee of £4.99. If you&#8217;d like to experiment with whether this app is for you, look instead for Superimpose X Neo. This is a more basic, free version of the app.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Once you have completed editing your photos, you will understandably be proud of them. Ensure that your hard work is not lost by accidentally deleting photos using the&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/">Dumpster</a>&nbsp;app – and be sure to keep your images protected with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/">Cover</a>.</p>

<p>Picture the scene. You have been chosen to make first contact with an alien race, and they notice your smartphone in your hand. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; they ask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You explain that it&#8217;s a tiny piece of technology that ensures you can listen to any song, watch any movie, research any subject or purchase any item – all at the touch of a button. &#8220;Wow!&#8221; our new intergalactic overlords will exclaim. &#8220;That&#8217;s astonishing. What do you use it for most?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How will you answer that question? If you&#8217;re being honest, you&#8217;ll probably say &#8220;watch funny cat videos and take selfies.&#8221; There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that – but it always helps to remember just what smartphones are capable of. Here are 10 apps that can make a positive difference to any Android user’s everyday life.</p>



<h2><strong>Microsoft To Do</strong></h2>



<p>Sick of finding scraps of paper around the house that were supposed to remind you of essential tasks? You need a To Do list. This offered by Microsoft’s app, which can constantly be referred to and updated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This app is free and takes a no-nonsense approach to managing your time. There&#8217;s nothing on the interface to distract you or encourage procrastination. The app will also make suggestions for activities based on patterns of activity. With Microsoft To Do, your productivity will skyrocket.</p>



<h2><strong>AirDroid</strong></h2>



<p>Smartphones have countless amazing qualities but storage space is rarely among them. If you&#8217;re trying to keep your spending on a handset down, it can be tough to find sufficient space to store all necessary apps, media files and any important documents. With AirDroid, there is no need to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This app acts as a mirror between your desktop PC and your smartphone, easily transferring documents between hardware with greater security than a conventional cloud drive. The basic version of AirDroid is free, with additional features available under a subscription model.</p>



<h2><strong>DuoLingo</strong></h2>



<p>As technology continues to advance, the world is getting smaller than ever. Whether travelling overseas or simply conversing with somebody from a different nation, there are more and more advantages to becoming multi-lingual. Google Translate is great, but it will never win awards for accuracy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DuoLingo makes it fun to learn a new language, offering short, sharp lessons that also function as games. It&#8217;s free to download and use, and there is a great deal of satisfaction to be gained from beating a previous score in a test.</p>



<h2><strong>MyFitnessPal</strong></h2>



<p>After a year in lockdown, it&#8217;s more important than ever that we take care of our physical fitness. There are a plethora of health and fitness apps out there, but we consider MyFitnessPal the finest. This app is a one-stop-shop for any wellbeing considerations.</p>



<p>You will need to pay for a subscription to MyFitnessPal, but you&#8217;ll get plenty of return on your investment. You can set weight loss goals, track the calories of what you have consumed, log your exercise and moment, and find a wide array of healthy and nutritious recipes to sample.</p>



<h2><strong>Headspace</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, it’s not just physical health that matters. We all need to check our mental health from time to time. If you’re keen to take a moment outside of your mind, learning the basics of meditation or mindfulness, Headspace is the app for you. It will help soothe anxiety, improve sleep and enhance your mental focus.</p>



<h2><strong>Whisk</strong></h2>



<p>Have you ever wandered the aisles of the supermarket in a daze, simply filling your trolley with the same ingredients as last week? Welcome to the human race. Whisk ensures that you&#8217;ll become a mean, lean consumer machine, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This app pulls the ingredients from any recipe you find online, and at the touch of a button creates a shopping list. With the aid of Whisk, you can plan meals for days or even weeks ahead and ensure that you shop appropriately.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Transit</strong></h2>



<p>If you find yourself in a strange city – or even a familiar one – getting around can be challenging. If you&#8217;re in a hurry, this becomes an ever-bigger concern. Transit will get you from A to B in the fastest way possible. Install this app and you will be furnished with real time information on bus routes, train times and road traffic. </p>



<p>With the aid of Transit, you&#8217;ll know whether you have a long wait for public transport or whether calling an Uber will lead to a frustrating wait in traffic with just Magic FM for company. It&#8217;s indispensable when negotiating unfamiliar terrain.</p>



<h2><strong>LastPass</strong></h2>



<p>If you follow the advice of security experts, you&#8217;ll have a different password for every app and website that you use. That&#8217;s safe, but it&#8217;s also more data than the human brain could ever hope to retain. If you use LastPass, you can maintain security without sacrificing your sanity.</p>



<p>This app will assign passwords to all the apps and sites that you frequent. Each one will be unique and strong, keeping malevolent hackers at bay. The app will save these passwords securely though, logging you in each time so you will always have access to what you need.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>MySupermarket</strong></h2>



<p>When shopping in a brick-and-mortar supermarket, you&#8217;ll likely choose whichever superstore is closest to your home or offers the best parking facilities. When it comes to home delivery, these logistics are redundant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the aid of the MySupermarket app, you can add items to a basket from the comfort of your own home. Once you&#8217;re done, the app will inform you which supermarket chain can provide your shopping for the lowest price. Spoiler alert – it&#8217;s unlikely to be Waitrose.</p>



<h2><strong>VoucherCodes</strong></h2>



<p>Everybody loves a bargain and outfoxing The Man by making a saving. Of all the coupon apps out there, Voucher Codes is the most comprehensive. Through GPS, this app will pinpoint any discount to be had in your area. This could be for a local eatery or a retail store.</p>



<p>Naturally though, Voucher Codes also accounts for online discounts. If you&#8217;re considering a purchase, install this free app first. You may find that you&#8217;re eligible for an unexpected saving with a bare minimum of effort.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Now, let’s go full circle here. You have installed these apps, and you’re delighted with your decision … but you’ll still want to protect those selfies and cat videos. With that in mind, we’d like to make two more recommendations –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coverapp.me/">Cover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/">Dumpster</a>. This way, you can rest assured that your treasured memories are secure – while also exploring everything the world of Android has to offer.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The way we reminisce over memories has changed drastically. While previous generations would have pored over a physical photo album to relive favoured days gone by, the world is not knee-deep into the digital revolution. This means that our lives are recorded via smartphones and tablets.</p>



<p>The advantages to this are clear. Moments can be captured in the blink of an eye and accessed at the touch of a button. Alas, it’s just as easy to&nbsp;<em>lose&nbsp;</em>photos this way. One clumsy thumb swipe, or a lack of sufficient attention, could see your wedding snaps or baby’s first steps banished into the online ether.</p>



<p>It’s important to know how to recover lost photos from a phone or tablet. This guide will explain exactly how you can do so.</p>



<h2>Cloud Drives</h2>



<p>Most Android appliances offer the opportunity to automatically back up all data on a handset to a cloud drive. If you accidentally delete a photo from your handset, there&#8217;s every chance it can still be found in the cloud. Just be aware that you&#8217;re going to need to act quickly.</p>



<p>The first thing to do is check your backup settings on your device. How often is your appliance set to back up the cloud, and at what time? If this is daily at midnight, you can quickly get your image back. Race into your cloud drive and check the photo drive. As the backup has not yet taken place, it has not yet been deleted from the cloud. Restore the photo to your handset and breathe.</p>



<p>Even you can&#8217;t find the photo in the cloud, do not immediately panic. Most cloud servers have a recycle bin. Check here – the photo may be in a holding pattern until the next backup is scheduled.</p>



<h2>Google Photos</h2>



<p>On paper, it&#8217;s even easier to retrieve a deleted file from Google Photos. Open the app, then head to your library. Click on the trash can icon, as this is your recycle bin. All being well, the image will be in this folder. You can simply highlight the file in question and click restore. This will return the photo to Google Photos, as well as any albums that you have set up.</p>



<p>This will only work if the image is in the trash, though. There are a few reasons why this may not be the case.</p>



<ul><li>The photo was deleted over 60 days ago – files are permanently deleted after this</li><li>You emptied your trash to free up space on your phone</li><li>Your phone&#8217;s storage limit has been exceeded</li></ul>



<p>If you cannot find the image, check a cloud drive as we discussed above. If you still don&#8217;t have any joy, all is not lost. As we&#8217;ll discuss in a moment, Dumpster can track down and restore the lost file.</p>



<h2>Dropbox</h2>



<p>Having mentioned cloud drives a couple of times now, we should give a special shout out to Dropbox. If you are going to back up your data, Dropbox is arguably the safest way to so. Even a free, basic Dropbox account saves deleted files for 30 days. If you&#8217;re prepared to pay a fee for an advanced account, they&#8217;ll be kept around for even longer.</p>



<p>Restoring a deleted photo from Dropbox is simple. Head to the folder that contains your photo and restore an old version from the history. As discussed, this could be from any update over the last 30 days. Just be aware that this will completely restore the old folder, so if you deleted a hundred photos but only want to save one, you&#8217;ll have to re-delete the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not sure&nbsp;<em>when</em>&nbsp;you deleted the photo and don&#8217;t fancy trawling through a month of versions, use Dropbox Rewind. This will restore your content to how it looked 30 days prior. Naturally though, this means that anything else you have backed up since this date will need to be saved again. Dropbox Rewind is essentially erasing the last 30 days from history.</p>



<h2>Dumpster</h2>



<p>So you&#8217;ve tried Dropbox, Google Photos and every cloud drive that you use to no avail. Under normal circumstances, we&#8217;d say that you live and learn – the file is gone. When you download Dumpster, however, normal circumstances do not apply.</p>



<p>Dumpster operates a recycle bin, where anything deleted from your device will be stored. These files will be compressed, so they have little impact on your storage allowance. You can restore anything from the recycle bin in a matter of seconds, even if it has been removed from other sources.</p>



<p>How about files that were deleted before you installed Dumpster, though? These, too, are accessible. Dumpster uses patented Deep Scan Recovery technology to locate photos thought lost. The app will rummage through the cache of your apps, as well as any hidden folders, to find the photo you&#8217;re looking for. From here, the image can be restored to your handset or tablet.</p>



<h2>How to Avoid it Next Time</h2>



<p>These steps are great for retrieving lost photos. Prevention is better than cure, though. It&#8217;s preferable to avoid your photos being deleted by mistake. We appreciate this is easier said than done, especially if you allow young children to use your phone!</p>



<p>To minimise the risk of unwanted photo deletion, take these steps.</p>



<ul><li>Download an external photo gallery app that backs up images (note that Instagram does not offer this service)</li><li>Set all photos in your phone or tablet as Read Only in settings</li><li>Place password protection or Face ID on your photo albums</li><li>Invest in an SD card so photos are physically backed up</li><li>Install Dumpster on your device, ensuring that nothing is permanently removed without your express permission</li></ul>



<p>Losing photos can be heartbreaking. As is the way of the internet, however, deleted does not mean lost forever. By utilising any of these techniques, most notably&nbsp;<a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/faq/how-does-deep-scan-recovery-work/">Dumpster’s Deep Scan Recovery technology</a>, your memories can be retrieved. Download Dumpster now and sleep easier knowing that your precious images are safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dumpster has been described as a lifesaver by countless Android smartphone and tablet users. After all, few experiences can compare with the sinking feeling of accidentally deleting treasured photographs from a device &#8211; potentially risking the banishment of some great memories in the process.</p>



<p>Dumpster eradicates this concern by providing the immediate opportunity to retrieve these images, whether from hardware directly or an external SD card.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now onto its third incarnation, Dumpster – the brainchild of Baloota Applications Ltd, who are also protecting countless Android users with the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector">Cover app</a> – has undergone a further round of improvements. It has truly never been easier to ensure that your photos and files remain safe and secure.</p>



<h2><strong>Why Should I Download Dumpster?</strong></h2>



<p>Dumpster utilises <a href="https://dumpsterapp.mobi/faq_cat/deep-scan-recovery/">Deep Scan Recovery technology</a>, designed and by Baloota Applications Limited, so restore any images or files removed from a device &#8211; whether by accident or design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of Dumpster as a Recycle Bin for your Android hardware. An errant thumb swipe will no longer banish your memories into the ether &#8211; you&#8217;ll be able to retrieve them with a simple touch of a button.</p>



<p>There are countless reasons why Dumpster is a must-install for any Android device user. Picture the following scenarios, and ask yourself – &#8220;could this happen to me?&#8221; If the answer is yes, Dumpster will provide invaluable peace of mind and assurance that no deletion is permanent!</p>



<ul><li>You hold sensitive images on your phone, such as financial data used for a credit application, and you’re worried they will fall into the wrong hands. You delete the images – only to find that you need them again in short order</li><li>You hand your phone over to your kids to keep them amused while you’re having a conversation with a friend. They hand it back – and you find that they have deleted a raft of important photos to make space for a game they wanted to install</li><li>You’re looking through photos and files as you wish to share them with somebody else through a message, and accidentally push the wrong button. Suddenly, the image is gone – and there is seemingly no way of getting it back</li><li>You have a video that you love to watch every and now and again, but it&#8217;s taking up more space on your appliance than you are comfortable with. With a heavy heart, you decide to delete it – but find yourself pining for the opportunity to enjoy it again within a few days</li></ul>



<p>As you’ll see, there are a range of reasons why any user may find themselves in need of the services of Dumpster. Download the app now and you’ll immediately enter a new world of confidence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Does Dumpster Work?</strong></h2>



<p>As discussed, Dumpster is akin to a Recycle Bin for a smartphone or tablet.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you download the app, your smartphone or tablet will enjoy a cloud-based service that backs up your files. This will be password-protected for your privacy – and if you pair <a href="https://baloota.com/">Dumpster with Cover</a>, another app from the Baloota stable, you’ll enjoy an even greater level of protection.</p>



<p>You can use Dumpster to retain files, images and videos in the Recycle Bin, freeing up space on your device but still enjoying instant access. These files can be restored to your appliance with the touch of a button, removing all stress and concern from the idea of losing any images you hold dear.</p>



<p>But what about the images that you lost before installing Dumpster? Do not worry – the use of Deep Scan Recovery ensures that even these files can also be retrieved. This technology locates and sources any files that are invisible on your device, whether simply invisible or still loitering in an app cache.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When images are deleted, these steps are taken by hardware to save memory, speed and data usage. Dumpster offers the same advantages – without depriving you of access to your files.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What’s New with Dumpster?</strong></h2>



<p>The latest Dumpster update &#8211; version 3.2 for those of you keeping score &#8211; has made a couple of key improvements to the app. The first, and arguably most critical, is the size. We have shrunk Dumpster down to an increasingly small download, making it the perfect place to store memories without sacrificing speed, performance or memory on your device.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, we have made Dumpster increasingly international. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so there is no reason why Dumpster users should be restricted by language barriers. We have added Swedish, Malay, Thai and Dutch to our list of languages, broadening the ability for users all over the world to enjoy Dumpster.</p>



<p>This is all in addition to the recent additions, the most notable of which is a tabbed view. Easily accessible from the bottom of the screen, you can choose whether you&#8217;d like to access the Recycle Bin, which offers easy, password-protected access to any videos, photos and files that may not be hosted on the hard drive of your appliance, or make use of the Deep Scan Recovery software – regaining access to materials that would otherwise have been lost.</p>



<p>If you’re still struggling with any bugs, we’re sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, it’s sometimes the nature of the beast when managing the ever-evolving world of technology and apps. We are constantly monitoring Dumpster for any quirks and foibles, but if you’re experiencing an issue please just let us know at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@baloota.com">support.dumpster@baloota.com</a> and we’ll look into rectifying it at once.</p>



<h2><strong>How Do I Get Dumpster?</strong></h2>



<p>It couldn’t be simpler to enjoy the peace of mind provided by Dumpster. Just head to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster">Google Play store and install</a>. As soon as you’ve done so, you can enjoy the knowledge that any image you accidentally erase – or even remove intentionally but later come to regret – can be restored to your appliance without fuss.</p>
