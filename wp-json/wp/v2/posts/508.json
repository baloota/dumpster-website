Some for photo storage, finances, maps, transportation, messages, social media, and the list goes on. Surprisingly, one of easiest ways to keep your device secure is to keep track of the passwords you use.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Dashlane, you can store an unlimited number of passwords and access them anywhere, sync data, create new heavy-duty secure passwords, and so much more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keep Track of Payments with <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.waveapps.sales&amp;hl=en_US\">Wave<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardest thing about being an independent photographer or freelancer isn\u2019t the work itself \u30fc it\u2019s managing your finances!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to keep better tabs on who owes you what, or need help organizing payments &amp; invoices in a central place, Wave is exactly the app you need. It\u2019s great to have for managing clients as well as keeping track of all of your records for tax season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=sp0n.citizen&amp;hl=en_US\">Citizen<\/a> Before Confirming Shoot Locations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizen is an app that notifies you of real-time safety alerts and live video of incidents happening around you. Citizen notifications have urged people to evacuate burning buildings, deterred school buses from nearby terrorist attacks and have even led to a rescue of a 1-year-old from a stolen car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you and your client visit your shoot location, it\u2019s in your best interest to ensure the location is safe. You\u2019re better off safe than sorry, especially if you\u2019re located in a metro area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Download Dumpster the #1 Photo &amp; Video Recovery Tool Today!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en_US\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dumpsterapp.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Get-it-on-Google-Play.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-572\" width=\"323\" height=\"125\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dumpsterapp.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Get-it-on-Google-Play.png 646w, https:\/\/dumpsterapp.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Get-it-on-Google-Play-300x116.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a photographer, it\u2019s important to keep your Android smartphone safe &amp; and equipped with the best apps at all times.
