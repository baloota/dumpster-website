Keep reading to find out one of our favorite utility Android apps! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can You Use AirPods on Android?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to contrary belief, yes, you can use AirPods on almost any Android phone or tablet. Although AirPods were designed with Apple products in mind, as long as bluetooth is enabled, AirPods will be able to connect to almost any device, regardless of operating system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AirPods don&#8217;t have a lot of their functionality on Android, such as: Siri, customized double tap, single AirPod listening, and so on, but you are still able to listen to audio. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to Find Your Airpods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fastest way to find your AirPods if you\u2019re an Android device user, is to download an app called <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hf.findlostdevice&amp;hl=en_US\">Wunderfind<\/a>: Find lost device &#8211; headphones. It&#8217;s an app that does exactly what it says it does! It can find your lost headphones, including AirPods, almost instantaneously. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once it\u2019s installed, all you need to do is select the device you need to find, in this case AirPods, then walk around so the app can detect how close you are to them. Wunderfind\u2019s Device Radar and Distance Score is what makes it great to use for practically any device.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s Device Radar is a unique functionality that shows you all of the Android or iOS devices around you within a certain distance. And it\u2019s Distance Score shows you how close you are to the device of your choosing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We highly recommend using Wunderfind because it\u2019s not just for finding lost AirPods. The app is compatible with the following devices &amp; technologies:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AirPods<\/li><li>Apple Pencil<\/li><li>&nbsp;iPhone<\/li><li>iPad<\/li><li>Apple Watch<\/li><li>Portable Speakers<\/li><li>Fitbit Trackers<\/li><li>And more<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Wunderfind is truly one of the most life-saving Android apps to have installed on your device, especially if you listen to music, <a href=\"https:\/\/dumpsterapp.mobi\/how-do-i-undelete-a-podcast-recording\/\">podcasts<\/a>, recordings, etc. on a daily basis. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do You Accidentally Lose Photos or Videos Frequently?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a clumsy or accident-prone person, in general, we\u2019d also recommend you use Dumpster. Dumpster is a backup app that over 40 Million people have used to restore accidentally deleted photos, videos, files, documents, and more!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No One Ever Regretted Trying Dumpster for Free<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.baloota.dumpster&amp;hl=en_US\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/dumpsterapp.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Get-it-on-Google-Play.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-572\" width=\"323\" height=\"125\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dumpsterapp.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Get-it-on-Google-Play.png 646w, https:\/\/dumpsterapp.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Get-it-on-Google-Play-300x116.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lost your AirPods?
